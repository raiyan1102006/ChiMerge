# ChiMerge
This is an implementation of the ChiMerge algorithm [1].

# What's in this Repository
This repository contains the iris dataset that I've used to test the ChiMerge algorithm on, and my code with comments embedded.

# Installation and Usage
The code has been developed using Jupyter Notebook, which can be installed from http://jupyter.org/install. Installing Jupyter using Anaconda brings with it all the popular libraries that this code uses, such as numpy, pandas and math. I have used Python 3.6.3 to develop and test the code.

Once the libraries and environments are set up, the code can by run from the Jupyter Notebook interface.
