# ChiMerge
Many classification algorithms require that the training data contain only discrete attributes. To use such an algorithm when there are numeric attributes, all numeric values must first be converted into discrete values---a process called discretization. This is an implementation of ChiMerge [1], a general, robust algorithm that uses the x2 statistic to discretize (quantize) numeric attributes.

## What's in this Repository
This repository contains the iris dataset that I've used to test the ChiMerge algorithm, and the python code of the algorithm.

## Installation and Usage
I have used Python 3.6.3 to develop and test the code, and have used only popular libraries such as numpy, pandas and math.

Once the libraries and environments are set up, the code can by run by executing 

```bash
python ChiMerge.py
```

## Algorithm
ChiMerge works in the following manner:
1. Sort the data based on the attributeâ€™s values in an ascending order.
2. Define each distinct value in the attribute as an interval on its own.
3. Construct a frequency table where the various class frequencies for each distinct attribute
value is computed.
4. Calculate the Chi square values for each of the adjacent rows (intervals) in the frequency
table.
5. Merge adjacent rows with the smallest Chi square value. This leads to a new frequency
table.
6. Repeat steps 4 & 5 until stopping condition is met.
